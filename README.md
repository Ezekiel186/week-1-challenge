# week-1-challenge

## Description

This project was the first homework assignment or "challenge" I had in my bootcamp. In this challenge we were given a working website and our task was to change some code snippets while making sure our changes doesn't change the website at all visually and functionally. I noticed that some code lines in the html were undescriptive and changed them accordingly to try to meet accessibility standards. Some lines in the css were also redundant/inefficient so I combined them. The very first couple changes I made were trial changes and had no real purpose in helping code efficiency or meeting standards.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website gives information about Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. However, I did not write the info myself, it was already there and I just changed some code. Uses for the changes I made can help me track my progress and provide a window to the past for future me to look back onto.
